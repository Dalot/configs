#### Optional ####
#cape allows you to use a modifier key as another key when pressed and released on its own. 
#Note that it is slightly slower than pressing the original key, 
#because the pressed event does not occur until the key is released. 
#The default behaviour is to generate the Escape key when Left Control is pressed and released on its own.
#xcape

#Because CAPSLOCK is just "right there" and making it CTRL when key-chording 
#and ESC when pressed alone is quite handy, specially in vi.
